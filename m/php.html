        <h1>Introduction to PHP Programming</h1>
        <h3>What is PHP?⁣</h3>
        <p>
            PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a versatile and widely used server-side scripting language for creating dynamic and interactive web
             applications. This PHP tutorial will give you an in-depth understanding of the PHP scripting language. Whether you are a beginner or 
             a professional PHP developer this free PHP tutorial will provide valuable knowledge about PHP scripting language.
            PHP is a popular scripting language used for creating dynamic web pages and web applications.
             The term PHP is an acronym of Hypertext Preprocessor. It is an open-source, interpreted, object-oriented server-side scripting
              language.With our PHP tutorial, you’ll learn all the important topics, including control statements, functions, arrays, strings, file handling, form handling, regular expressions, date and time manipulation, object-oriented programming in PHP, mathematical operations, working with PHP and MySQL, integrating PHP with Ajax, harnessing the power of PHP with jQuery, and more.
        </p>
        <p>First Hello World Program in PHP
            <br><br>Let us now look at the program :<br>
        </p>
        <code class="code">
            <div class=highlight><pre><span></span><span class=cp>&lt;?php</span>
 
            <span class=cm>/* echo is a print command */</span>
            <span class=k>echo</span> <span class=s2>&quot;Hello world!&quot;</span><span class=p>;</span> 
            
            <span class=cp>?&gt;</span>
            </pre></div></code>

        <h3>Features of PHP</h3>
        <p>
            <li>Open-Source and Free: PHP is firstly open source which means anyone can use PHP code without any licensing. Along with this one can run PHP on any operating system like Windows, macOS, Linux, Unix and more.</li>
            <li>PHP Server-Side Scripting: PHP code executes on the server before sending HTML content to the user’s browser, allowing for the dynamic generation of web pages and handling user interactions.</li>
            <li>Interpreted language: PHP code is interpreted line by line, eliminating the need for compilation and simplifying development and testing processes.</li>
            <li>Database connectivity: PHP integrates seamlessly with various databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle, facilitating data storage and retrieval for web applications. </li>
            <li>Object-oriented programming (OOP): PHP supports OOP concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism, enabling better code organization and modularity.</li>
            <li>Built-in functions: PHP comes with a rich set of built-in functions for various tasks such as string manipulation, date and time handling, file handling, and more, reducing the need for external libraries.
            </li>

    <section id="basics">
        <h2>PHP Data Types, Operators & User I/O</h2>
        <p>Data Types define the type of data a variable can store. PHP allows eight different types of data types. All of them are discussed below. There are pre-defined, user-defined, and special data types.
        </p>

        <h3>The predefined data types are:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Boolean</li>
             <li> Integer</li>  
              <li>Double</li>  
               <li>String</li>
        </ul>
       
        <h3>The user-defined (compound) data types are:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Arrays</li>
            <li>Objects</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The special data types are:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Null</li>
            <li>resourcs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The first five are called simple data types and the last three are compound data types: </h3>
        <p> <span class="bold"></span>1. Integer: Integers hold only whole numbers including positive and negative numbers, i.e., numbers without fractional part or decimal 
            point. They can be decimal (base 10), octal (base 8), or hexadecimal (base 16). The default base is decimal (base 10). The octal integers can be declared with leading 0 and the hexadecimal can be declared with leading 0x. The range of integers must lie between -2^31 to 2^31. </p>
        <h3>C Constants</h3>
        When you don't want the variables you declare to get modified intentionally or mistakenly in the <br>later part
        of
        your program by you or others, you use the const keyword (this will declare the variable as "constant",<br>
        which
        means unchangeable and read-only).
        You should always declare the variable as constant when you have values that are unlikely to change,<br> like
        any
        mathematical constant as PI.
        When you declare a constant variable, it must be assigned a value.
        </p>

        <p>The array types and structure types are referred collectively as the aggregate types. The type of a <br>
            function
            specifies
            the type of the function's return value. We will see the basic types in the following section, where <br> as
            other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="Conditional">
        <h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
        <p>
        <h3> IF...Else statements</h3>Sometimes, we wish to execute one set of instructions if a particular
        condition
        is met, and another set of instructions if it is not.
        This kind of situation is dealt with in C language using a decision control system.

        The condition for the if statement is always enclosed within a pair of parentheses.
        If the condition is true, then the set of statements following the if statement will execute.
        And if the condition evaluates to false, then the statement will not execute, instead, the program skips
        that
        enclosed part of the code.
        An expression in if statements are defined using relational operators. Comparing two values using relational
        operators allows us to determine
        whether they are equal, unequal, greater than, or less than.
        If we want to execute a particular code in some situation and its vice versa /opposite/or different code if that
        situation doesn’t occurs then if..else statements can be used.
        Its all depend on the condition. If the condition returns true value the situation has occurred and the
        true part of
        code will be executed and if condition returns false value false part of the code will be executed</p>
        <h4> Syntax of if-else statements:</h4>
        <code>if ( condition ){<br>
            statements;}<br>
             else {<br>
            statements;} <br>
            </code>
        <p>
        <h3>Switch Case Statements</h3>
        <h4>What is Switch?</h4>The control statement that allows us to make a decision effectively from the number
        of
        choices is called a switch, or a switch case-default since these three keywords go together to make up the
        control statement. The expression in switch returns an integral value, which is then compared with different
        cases. Switch executes that block of code, which matches the case value. If the value does not match with
        any of
        the cases, then the default block is executed.
        <h4> Syntax of Switch statements:</h4>
        <code>switch ( integer expression ) 
        {  <br>
        case {value 1} : <br>  
        do this ; <br>
         
        case {value 2} : <br>  
         do this ;  <br>
        case {value 3} : <br>  
        do this ; <br> 
         
        default : <br>  
        do this ; <br>
         } 
        </code></p>

    </section>
    <section id="Iteration">
        <h2>Iteration Statements</h2>
        <p>
        <h3>C Loops</h3>In programming, we often have to perform an action, again and again, with little or no
        variations in the details each time they are executed. This need is met by a mechanism known as a loop.

        The versatility of the computer lies in its ability to perform the set of instructions repeatedly. This involves
        repeating some code in the program, either a specified number of times or until a particular condition is
        satisfied. Loop-controlled instructions are used to perform this repetitive operation efficiently ensuring the
        program doesn’t look redundant at the same time due to the repetitions.
        <h4>Following are the three types of loops in C programming.</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>For loop</li>
            <li>While loop</li>
            <li>do-while loop</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>For Loop</h3>
        <p>A for loop is a repetition control structure that allows us to efficiently write a loop that will execute a
            specific number of times. The for loop working is as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>The initialization statement is executed only once; in this statement, we initialize a variable to some
                value.</li>
            <li>The initialization statement is executed only once; in this statement, we initialize a variable to some
                value.</li>
            <li>The loop keeps executing until the test expression is false. When the test expression is false, then the
                loop terminates. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4> Syntax of For Loop:</h4>
        <code>for (initialise counter; test counter; increment / decrement counter) <br>
    { <br>
        //set of statements
    } <br>
    </code></p>
        </p>
        <h3>While Loop</h3>While loop is called a pre-tested loop. The while loop allows code to be executed multiple
        times, depending upon a boolean condition that is given as a test expression. While introducing for loops, we
        saw that the number of iterations is known, whereas while loops are used in situations where we do not know the
        exact number of iterations of the loop. The while loop execution is terminated based on the test condition which
        evaluates to either true or false.
        <h4> Syntax of While Loop:</h4>
        <code>while (condition test) <br>
            { <br>
                // Set of statements <br>
            }
            
    </code></p>
        </p>
        <h3> Do-While Loop</h3>In do-while loops, the execution is terminated based on the test condition, very similar
        to how it is done in a while loop. The main difference between the do-while loop and while loop is that, in the
        do-while loop, the condition is tested at the end of the loop body, whereas the other two loops are
        entry-controlled. In a do-while loop, the loop body will execute at least once irrespective of the test
        condition <br>
        Sometimes, while executing a loop, it becomes necessary to jump out of the loop. For this, we make use of the
        break statement and the continue statement
        <h4> Syntax of Do-While Loop:</h4>
        <code>do <br>
            {
                statements; <br>
            } while (test condition); <br>            
</code></p>

    <section id="Arrays">
        <h2>Arrays</h2>
        <p>
        <h3>Array Basics</h3>
        An array is a collection of data items of the same data type. And it is also known as a subscript variable.
        <ul>
            <li>Items are stored at contiguous memory locations in arrays.</li>
            <li>It can also store the collection of derived data types such as pointers, structures, etc.</li>
            <li>The C Language places no limits on the number of dimensions in an array. This means we can create arrays
                of any number of dimensions. It could be a 2D array or a 3D array or more.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Dimensions of an array</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A one-dimensional array is like a list.</li>
            <li>A two-dimensional array is like a table.</li>
        </ul>
        Some texts refer to one-dimensional arrays as vectors and two-dimensional arrays as matrices and use the general
        term arrays when the number of dimensions is unspecified or unimportant.
        <h3>Properties of Arrays</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>An array stores data be it of any data type in contiguous memory locations in RAM.</li>
            <li>Each element of an array is of the same size i.e. their data types are the same so the memory consumed
                by each is also the same.</li>
            <li>Any element of the array with a given index can be accessed very quickly by using its address which can
                be calculated using the base address and the index number.</li>
            <li>Index Number – It is the special type of number which allows us to access variables of arrays. Index
                number provides a method to access each element of an array in a program.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Defining an Array</h4>
        <h5>1. Without specifying the size of the array</h5>
        <code> int arr[]={1,2,3};</code>
        <h5>1. With specifying the size of the array</h5>
        <code> int arr[3] <br>
    arr[0]=1,arr[1]=2,arr[2]=3;

</code>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Strings">
        <h2>Strings</h2>
        <p>
        <h3>What are Strings?</h3>
        A string is an array of characters. Data of the same type are stored in an array, for example, integers can be
        stored in an integer array, similarly, a group of characters can be stored in a character array. This character
        array is also known as strings. A string is a one-dimensional array of characters that is terminated by a null
        (‘\0’).
        <h2>Declaration of Strings:</h2>
        Declaring a string is very simple, the same as declaring a one-dimensional array. It’s just that we are
        considering it as an array of characters.
        <h4> Below is the syntax for declaring a string.</h4>
        <code>char string_name[string_size]; <br> <br></code>
        In the above syntax, string_name is any name given to the string variable, and size is used to define the length
        of the string, i.e the number of characters that the strings will store. Keep in mind that there is an extra
        terminating character which is the null character (‘\0’) that is used to indicate the termination of the string.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Function">
        <h2> Functions</h2>
        <p>
            Functions are used to divide a large C program into smaller and less complex pieces.
            Function can be called multiple or several times to provide reusability and modularity to the C program.
            Functions are also called procedures or subroutines or methods.
            A function is also a piece of code that performs a specific task.
            A function is nothing but a group of code put together and given a name and it can be called anytime without
            writing the whole code again and again in a program.
            I know its syntax is a bit difficult to understand but don’t worry after reading this whole information
            about Functions you will know each and every term or thing related to Functions.
            <code> <br>
                #include [stdio.h] <br> 
                    // Function declaration <br>
                    void func(); <br>
                    int main() <br>
                    { <br>
                        func(); // calling the function 
                        return 0; <br>
                    } <br>
                    // Function definition <br>
                    void func() <br>
                    {
                        printf("This is the definition part."); <br>
                    }
            </code>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Pointer">
        <h2> Pointers</h2>
        When we initialise an array, we usually come to know about the,
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Memory block which is the space a variable gets in RAM. We can think of that space as a block.</li>
            <li>Name of the memory block which is the variable’s name itself.</li>
            <li>Content of that block that is the value stored in that variable</li>
            <li>Address of the memory block assigned to the variable which is a unique address that allows us to access
                that variable.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What is a Pointer?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pointer is a variable that contains the address of another variable. It means, it is a variable that
                points to any other variable.</li>
            <li>Although this is itself a variable, this contains the address or memory address of any other variable.
            </li>
            <li>It can be of type int, char, array, function, or even any other pointer.</li>
            <li>It can be of type int, char, array, function, or even any other pointer.</li>
            <li>Pointers in C Language can be declared using *(asterisk symbol).
                So, pointers are nothing but variables that store addresses of other variables, and by using pointers,
                we can access other variables too and can even manipulate them</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Applications of Pointers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pointers are used to dynamically allocate or deallocate memory using methods such as malloc(),
                realloc(), calloc(), and free().</li>
            <li>Pointers are used to point to several containers such as arrays, or structs, and also for passing
                addresses of containers to functions.</li>
            <li>Return multiple values from a function </li>
            <li>Rather than passing a copy of a container to a function, we can simply pass its pointer. This helps
                reduce the memory usage of the program.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Here’s one example to demonstrate the use of the address of the operator.</h4>
        <code> <br>
            #include <stdio.h> <br>
            int main() <br>
            {
                int a = 100; <br>
                printf("%d\n", a); <br>
                printf("Address of variable a is %d", &a); <br>
                return 0; <br>
            }
            </code>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Memory">
        <h2> Memory Management</h2>
        <p>
        <h3>Local Variables</h3>Local variables are variables that are declared inside a function or a block of code.
        These variables cannot be accessed outside the function they are declared in. Local variables can be accessed
        only by statements that are inside that function or block of code which means the scope of these variables will
        be within the function only.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Global Variables</h3>Global variables are variables that are defined outside of all the functions. Global
        variables hold their values, and we can access them inside any of the functions defined in the program. When we
        define global variables, the system automatically initializes them.

        If cases where we have both the local and global variables with the same name declared, the local variable takes
        preference.</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Static Variables</h3>A static variable is a variable that retains its value even after the program exits the
        scope it was declared in. Static variables retain their value and are not initialized again in the new scope.
        The memory assigned to a static variable stays until the end of the program is reached, whereas a normal
        variable is destroyed when a function it was declared in gets exited. They can be defined inside or outside the
        function. Static variables are local to the block. The default value of a static variable is zero. The keyword
        static is used to declare a static variable.
        <h4>Syntax:</h4>static datatype variable_name = variable_value;</p>
        <p>
        <h3>Memory Allocation</h3>
        <h4> malloc():</h4> malloc stands for memory allocation. This inbuilt function requests memory from the heap and
        returns a pointer to the memory. The pointer is of the void type and we can typecast it to any other data type
        of our choice.
        All the values at the allocation time are initialized to garbage values. The function expects the memory space
        along with the size we want in bytes at the time it is used.
        <h5>Syntax:</h5> ptr = (ptr - type *)malloc(size_in_bytes) <br>
        <h4> calloc():</h4> calloc stands for contiguous memory allocation. Similar to malloc, this function also
        requests memory from the heap and returns a pointer to the memory. Differences lie in the way we have to call
        it.
        First, we have to send as parameters the number of blocks needed along with their size in bytes. Second, in
        calloc(), the values at the allocation time are initialized to 0 instead of garbage value unlike what happens in
        malloc().
        <h5>Syntax:</h5> ptr = (ptr - type *)calloc(n, size_in_bytes) <br></p>
        <h4>realloc():</h4> realloc stands for reallocation of memory. It is used in cases where the dynamic memory
        allocated previously is insufficient and there is a need of increasing the already allocated memory to store
        more data
        We also pass the previously declared memory address, and the new size of the memory in bytes while calling the
        function.
        <h5>Syntax:</h5>ptr = (ptr - type *)realloc(ptr, new_size_in_bytes) <br></p>
        <h4>Free():</h4> While discussing the disadvantages of dynamic memory allocation, it was mentioned that there is
        no automatic deletion of dynamically allocated memory when the pointer gets overwritten. So, to manually do it,
        we use the free() function to free up the allocated memory space. Therefore, free() is used to free up the space
        occupied by the allocated memory.
        We just have to pass the pointer as a parameter inside the function and the address being pointed gets freed
        <h5>Syntax:</h5>free(ptr);<br></p>

        <h2>Structures & Unions</h2>
        <p>
        <h3>Structures</h3>
        <p>We have already learnt in the previous tutorials that variables store one piece of information and arrays of
            certain data types store the information of the same data type. Variables and arrays can handle a great
            variety of situations. But quite often, we have to deal with the collection of dissimilar data types. For
            dealing with cases where there is a requirement to store dissimilar data types, C provides a data type
            called ‘structure’. It is a way to group together information belonging to different data types and combine
            them into one structure.</p>
        <h4>What are Structures in C?</h4>
        Structures are usually used when we wish to store data of different data types together. For example, if we want
        to store information about a book, there could be a number of parameters defining a book.
        Books have a title, an author name, the number of pages, and a price. All of the book attributes belong to
        different data types. The titles and author names must be strings, but the prices and number of pages must be
        numerical.
        One way to store the data is to construct individual arrays, and another method is to use a structure variable.
        It is to keep in mind that structure elements are always stored in contiguous memory locations.
        <h4>Creating a struct element</h4>
        <code><br>
            #include <stdio.h> <br>
            struct Books <br>
            {
                char title[20]; <br>
                char author[100]; <br>
                float price; <br>
                int pages; <br>
            }; <br>
            int main() <br>
            {
                struct Books book1; <br>
                return 0; <br>
            }</code>
        <h3>Unions</h3>
        Just like Structures, the union is a user-defined data type. All the members in unions share the same memory
        location. The union is a data type that allows different data belonging to different data types to be stored in
        the same memory locations. One of the advantages of using a union is that it provides an efficient way of
        reusing the memory location, as only one of its members can be accessed at a time. A union is used in the same
        way we declare and use a structure. The difference lies just in the way memory is allocated to their members
       <h4>Defining a Union</h4>
    <code>
        #include [stdio.h] <br>
            union Books <br>
            {
                char title[20]; <br>
                char author[100]; <br>
                float price; <br>
                int pages; <br>
            };   <br> 
            int main() <br>
            {
                union Books book1; <br>
                return 0; <br>
            }
            
    </code> </p>
